===========

Thunderbird extension, add ordered and numbered link in your mail.

My first extension. Suffers from all the classic problems of youth, is arrogant and dirty. I added a small todo list, probably unnecessarily.
It's impossible to automatically add buttons to the toolbar. On your first run, at message creation window, *View -> Toolbars -> Customize* and select *Linkography*.

- [x] first, minimally functional version
- [ ] code review, search for elegance
- [ ] add the possibility to retrieve the title of the url
- [ ] converting to bootstrapped extension
